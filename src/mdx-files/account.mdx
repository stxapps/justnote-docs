Your account is cryptographically generated; only you, with your Secret Key, can control it.

When you use Brace.to, your account is cryptographically generated. You'll receive a Secret Key — a unique set of 24 words that acts like a password — used to derive your account with cryptographic algorithms. Only you know your Secret Key and only your Secret Key can be used to create your account and make changes to it. **Your account cannot be locked, banned, or deleted by anyone, as your Secret Key is required to access and modify your account.**

## Stacks Account

Your account is [a Stacks account](https://docs.stacks.co/concepts/network-fundamentals/accounts), and a Stacks account is used to access [the Stacks blockchain](https://explorer.hiro.so) and [a Stacks data server](https://docs.stacks.co/concepts/gaia). The Stacks blockchain stores your account information, such as your username, profile, and data server location. A Stacks data server stores your encrypted app data, such as all your saved links.

Your Secret Key acts like a password. It's only known to you, ensuring that only you can decrypt your data and see the content inside. If you lose it, there is no way to retrieve it back. You need to keep it safe.

Your Secret Key cannot be changed or reset. As it's used to encrypt your content file by file, if you change your Secret Key, every file needs to be decrypted with your old Secret Key and encrypted again with your new Secret Key.

## Delete Account

No one without your Secret Key can access your account or content, so you don't need to delete them. To delete all your data, please go to Settings → Data → Delete All Data.

Your Stacks account is generated by a cryptographic algorithm and your Secret Key. Forgetting your Secret Key is the only way to delete your account.

If you've started with us, we create your Stacks account without a username, profile, or data server location. So, no data is stored in the Stacks blockchain, and your data is stored in our provided server by default.

After you delete all your data in Settings → Data → Delete All Data, there's nothing left. You can forget your Secret Key. It's permanently deleting your account.
